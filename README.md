>
> Key Concepts:
>
> - Software "Testers" (traditional)
>   - Trigger failures and find defects (typically at the end of the development lifecycle)
>
> vs.
>
> - Quality Assurance Engineers (modern)
>   - Evaluate work products such as requirements, timelines, user stories, designs, and code 
>   - Trigger failures and find defects
>   - Ensure required coverage of the complete end to end test object
>   - Reduce the level of risk of inadequate software quality (reduce risk, not ensure perfection)
>   - Verify requirements have been fulfilled
>   - Verify the test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements
>   - Provide information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions
>   - Build confidence in the quality of the test object
>   - Validate the test object is complete and works as stakeholders expect it to
>
> - The context of testing will vary, depending upon the project 
> - The concepts of testing are the same
